        <b>Khichri</b> (or <strong>Khichdi</strong>) is a popular dish in many South Asian 
        countries, especially in <em>India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan</em>. It's made from 
        rice and lentils, typically cooked together with spices, and often served as comfort food. It's simple, 
        nutritious, and can be made in various ways depending on regional preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Khichri is the ultimate comfort food â€” warm, hearty, and soothing for both body and soul. Imagine soft, 
        fluffy rice blending perfectly with creamy lentils, simmered together in a fragrant bath of turmeric, 
        cumin, and a hint of ginger. Every spoonful is a burst of flavors: savory, slightly earthy, with just 
        the right amount of spice. A dollop of ghee adds a rich, golden sheen, making it melt in your mouth. 
        Paired with tangy yogurt or a spicy pickle, it's like a cozy hug for your taste buds. Whether you enjoy 
        it on a rainy day or as a simple meal to unwind, Khichri never fails to deliver that warm, comforting 
        feeling we all crave.

    <h3>Steps to Make Khichri:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Ingredients:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Rinse the rice and moong dal in water until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>If you're using vegetables, chop them into small pieces.</li>

        </ul>
        <li>Cook Spices:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large pot or pressure cooker, heat the ghee (or oil) on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds. Let them splutter for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Add grated ginger and green chilies. Stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>

        </ul>
        <li>Add Vegetables (Optional):</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you're using vegetables like carrots, peas, and potatoes, add them now. Stir-fry them for a couple of minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cook Rice and Dal:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the washed rice and moong dal to the pot. Stir them for a minute to mix with the spices and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Add turmeric powder, ground coriander, and salt to taste. Stir to coat the rice and dal with the spices.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Add Water:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pour in 4 cups of water. Stir everything together.</li>
            <li>If using a pressure cooker, cover and cook for about 2-3 whistles (around 10 minutes on medium heat). For a regular pot, bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer covered for about 20-25 minutes until the rice and dal are fully cooked and soft. Add more water if needed for a softer consistency. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Final Touches:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the Khichri is cooked, check the seasoning and adjust the salt. You can add more water if you prefer a soupy consistency. </li>
            <li>Optionally, add a squeeze of lemon juice for extra flavor and a sprinkle of garam masala. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Garnish and Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro and serve hot with a side of yogurt, pickle, or papadam for a complete meal. </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
