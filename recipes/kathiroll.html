        A <strong>Kathiroll</strong> roll is a popular street food from India, especially associated with <em>Kolkata.</em>
         It's a type of wrap where paratha (or sometimes other flatbreads) is filled with 
         various ingredients like marinated meat (chicken, mutton, or beef), paneer (for a 
         vegetarian version), onions, sauces, and sometimes an egg, all rolled up together.
    </p>
    <p>
        The filling is often spiced with tangy sauces, and it’s typically served hot with
         a side of chutney or a salad. The beauty of a kathi roll lies in its versatility; 
         you can customize it with different fillings, sauces, and veggies based on your 
         taste preferences. They make for a delicious, portable snack or meal.

        Imagine biting into a warm, crispy paratha, slightly charred from the griddle, 
        wrapped around a succulent, spiced filling that dances with flavor. The tender pieces
         of marinated chicken (or juicy paneer, if you're vegetarian) are kissed with smoky,
          tangy spices, each bite bursting with zest. A layer of caramelized onions adds just
           the right touch of sweetness, while a drizzle of cool, creamy yogurt or spicy chutney
            balances the heat. The wrap is soft yet crispy, a perfect contrast of textures that 
            makes every mouthful irresistible. It's a flavor-packed, mouthwatering masterpiece 
            that leaves you craving more with every bite.
